To make the MCJet calibrations:

1) Get the and build the code for your release and go to test area

     scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_1_0_3
     cd CMSSW_1_0_3/src
     cmscvsroot CMSSW
     cvs co -r JetResponseV4 JetMETCorrections/MCJet
     eval `scramv1 runtime -csh`
     scramv1 b
     cd JetMETCorrections/MCJet/test

2) modify test config SimJetResponseAnalysis.cfg to point to your test sample.

3) run test job

     cmsRun SimJetResponseAnalysis.cfg >&! SimJetResponseAnalysis.log &

   and look at output file SimJetResponseMidPoint_R05_test.root

4) Modify full config files to point at your full sample
   Modify SimJetCSA06*.cfg and write out SimJet*.cfg without the CSA06
   (SimJet_MidpointR5.cfg,  SimJet_MidpointR7.cfg, SimJetCSA06_IterativeR5.cfg, etc.)
   
5) Run createCondorJob.csh and examine the output job for MidpointR5.

6) Submit the job with condor_submit CondorJob_MidPointR5

7) Create the rest of the jobs
     source moreCondorJobs.csh 
   and submit them
     condor_submit CondorJob_MidPointR7
     condor_submit CondorJob_IterativeR5
     condor_submit CondorJob_Kt
     
8) When the jobs complete make the checking scripts
     source makeCheckingScripts.csh
   and run them
     source runChecksMC5.csh
     source runChecksMC7.csh
     source runChecksIC5.csh
     source runChecksKT.csh
   examining the histos and type .q at the root prompt between plots.  You will
   be in the check directory and the check plots will be saved in check/plots/

9)
